## 2.8 - Schemas
[x] Integrate Schema protocol from Ulixee 1.x
  When writing a number of Databoxes inside the same Domain, it can be beneficial to validate the data format of the results. These “schemas” validate formats and can help identify when a querySelector did not work.
- Domain documentation
  Each Domain comes with a documentation website containing pricing information, example usage and input/output details.

## 2.10 - Domain Registry
Domains can be published to one or more centralized registries or marketplaces.

## 2.11 - Auto-generated Schemas
- Auto-generate Schemas from Results
  Ideally, we’d like to automatically create the schemas since they can be tedious to create.
