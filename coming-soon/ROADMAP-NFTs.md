NFTs will be deployed as standard ERC721 contracts, initially on Ethereum. We might do a multichain deployment, but current thinking is Ethereum to start. We’ll create a simple mechanism to associate a Datastore or Domain with a created NFT via the CLI/UI tooling. We will associate Datastore and Domain earnings with a registered Argon address. To transfer funds out of an Argon “owner” address, a user will need to lock their NFT ownership for a number of blocks to initiate a transfer out of that Argon address into a normal address.

- ERC 721 Contract
- Register NFT to Datastore
- Sidechain Specialized Addresses
- Ownership
- Transfer Funds out of Specialized Addresses
- Transfer between Federated Sidechains?

## 2.8 - Expand Domains
- Register NFT to Domain

## 2.10 - Trading
NFTs will be publishable on marketplaces of choice. We’ll need to ensure we check for current ownership before we allow funds to be transferred out of them.
