# Deployment

## Packaging

Databoxes are packaged into a single javascript file for deployment. They include a sourcemap and manifest file indicating how to run the Databox.

We provide a packaging tool out of the box to combine your Databox and included modules into a single file. It can be run using the Databox CLI commands or the Ulixee CLI.

#### Typescript Support

The packager can optionally process Typescript files for you. If you have a unique Typescript setup, you can also point the packager at your output Javascript files. The Packager will automatically import any sourcemaps.

#### ES Modules vs CommonJS

The packager can process ES Modules or CommonJS. It will output a commonjs file so that Ulixee Server can import it on a server. The server will run your Databox in an isolated Sandbox for each run. No memory or variables are shared between runs.

#### Databox CLI:

```bash
 npx @ulixee/databox package [path to databox entrypoint]
```

You must provide a path to the entrypoint of your Databox. The default export of the node module needs to be an instance of a `DataboxWrapper`.

By default, your Databox will be packaged up into a folder called `.databox` directly next to your script. The folder contains your rolled up script, a sourcemap, and a manifest.json file. It's safe to delete this folder after your upload. You can also choose to output your packaged databoxes into a different location using the `--output-dir` option described below.

#### Ulixee CLI

First, make sure to install the Global Ulixee CLI: `npm install -g @ulixee/cli`. 

Then run the `databox package` command from a command line inside your project directory:

```bash
 ulixee databox package [path to databox entrypoint]
```

#### CLI Options

Options below show a short and long form.

- `-u, --upload` `Boolean`. Upload this package to a Ulixee Server after packaging. (default: false)
- `-h, --upload-host` `String`. Upload this package to the given host server. Will try to auto-connect if none specified.
- `-o, --output-dir` `String`. A directory to output the file to. Defaults to a `.databox` directory next to the input file.
- `-t, --tsconfig` `String`. A path to a TypeScript config file (if needed). Will attempt to be auto-located based on the entrypoint if it ends in ".ts"

## Manifest

When you package a Databox, a Manifest is created with the following properties:

- scriptRollupHash `string`. This is a Sha3-256 hash of the rolled-up script. It is used to version your script and refer to it in queries to remote Servers. The encoding uses a base32 format called Bech32m so that it's file-path friendly.
- scriptEntrypoint `string`. The relative path to your file (from the closest package.json).
- runtimeName `string`. The "type" of Databox runtime used internally.
- runtimeVersion `string`. The version of the Databox module. Your script will be checked for compatibility with the Server npm modules before it runs.

This file will be automatically generated by the CLI. The `scriptRollupHash` is a good sanity check to compare versions on your local machine vs a Server. By default, Ulixee Servers store Databoxes in the `<OS Cache Directory>/ulixee/databoxes` directory ([details](/docs/databox/overview/configuration#storage)).

## Uploading

You can upload Databoxes to a Ulixee Server automatically when you package them. If you decide to first examine the package, you can also choose to upload later (or deploy directly to the [Databoxes directory](/docs/databox/overview/configuration#storage) during your Server installation).

If you upload using the CLI, you can use the following command:

#### Databox CLI

```bash
 npx @ulixee/databox upload [path to pre-packaged databox]
```

... or via Ulixee CLI:

```bash
 ulixee databox upload [path to pre-packaged databox]
```

You must provide a path to the pre-packaged databox directory. The directory must be a folder containing:

- `databox.js` The single file containing all your javascript code and a default export contanining DataboxWrapper instance.
- `databox.js.map` A source map for your javascript.
- `manifest.json` A manifest file with a valid hash code. See Manifest section above.

#### CLI Options

Options below show a short and long form.

- `-h, --upload-host` `String`. Upload this package to the given host server. Will try to auto-connect if none specified.

## Databox Core Sandboxes

When Databoxes are run on a Server, they are initialized into a virtual machine sandbox that has no access to Node.js modules beyond the `Hero`, `Databox` and `Unblocked` modules. Your dependencies will be imported into your package, but you should not expect NodeJs core xs to be available. Your script will also be fully isolated between runs - any shared state must be provided in via the `input` variables. This isolation ensures your script can be reproduced, re-run and troubleshooted reliably.

## Efficient Units

Once Databoxes have been deployed, the can be remotely queried using only the unique "Hash" of the databox and any input configuration. The output will be the only information transmitted in response.
