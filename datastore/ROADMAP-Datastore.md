## 2.1
We want to be able to “build” a datastore into a package that can be deployed onto a Miner where it can be run efficiently to output only data.
- Localization Configuration
[x] Record streaming - ability to emit each single record as it’s retrieved

## 2.6 - Virtual Machines
For a community of Miners to exist that can host Hero scripts, we need a secure environment to run in. This environment might also need to measure or constrain processing time and memory used.
[x] Security Sandboxing
- Measure CPU/Memory
- Constrain CPU/Memory

## 2.8 - Schemas
[x] Integrate Schema protocol from Ulixee 1.x
When writing a number of Datastores inside the same Domain, it can be beneficial to validate the data format of the results. These “schemas” validate formats and can help identify when a querySelector did not work.
[x] Domain documentation
Each Domain comes with a documentation website containing pricing information, example usage and input/output details.

## 2.10 - Datastore Registry
Datastores can be published to one or more centralized registries or marketplaces.

## 2.11 - Auto-generated Schemas
- Auto-generate Schemas from Results
  Ideally, we’d like to automatically create the schemas since they can be tedious to create.
