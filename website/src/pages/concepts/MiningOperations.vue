# Mining Operations

Ulixee's Rigs are network hubs that provide services to “Miners”. Services include IP proxies, mainchain block tracking, and network resource (schemas/datastore) lookups. Rigs also provide a fixed IP address that can route through to Miners without a need for miner machines to provision static IP addresses.
